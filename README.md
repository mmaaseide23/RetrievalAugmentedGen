Retrieval-Augmented Generation for DS4300 Notes
Welcome to the repo for our a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to help students review course material by querying their own class notes using locally run LLMs.

Through testing we have determined what we believe to be the optimal combination of ingestion methods, querying, and LLM model. Here we will give you the instructions to use the repo for this
method we have decided upon. Before using this repo, you will need to make sure that you are using an environment with all of the libraries in our requirements.txt. Additionally, we currently 
have our notes uploaded as the data to be used for our system, if you are using this for a different purpose you will have to remove our data and upload the data you would like to be
used for the RAG system.

Ingestion: We have determined __ and __ are optimal technologies to use for ingestion. To use this, navigate to __Ingest.py to start. From there all you will need to do is run the file and
make sure that...

LLM execution: As we are using __ for our ingestion, for the execution you will start by navigating to the __Execute.py file. From there you will need to run the file and navigate to the
terminal that opens when you do so. From there you should have a query line that shows up where you can query the RAG system and it will output its repsonse to your query.
